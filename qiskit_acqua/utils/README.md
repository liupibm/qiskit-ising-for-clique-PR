# QISKit ACQUA - Utils

QISKit Algorithms and Circuits for QUantum Applications (QISKit ACQUA) is a set of algorithms and utilities
for use with quantum computers. 
The *utils* folder here contains common software and pluggable objects that may be used by algorithms 

In addition to common utility code in this folder the following pluggable objects exist within their respective 
designated folders: 

* [Optimizers](./optimizers/README.md): Optimizers, both local and global
* [Variational Forms](./variational_forms/README.md): Trial wavefunctions
* [Initial States](./initial_states/README.md): States that may be used for by variational methods
* [IQFTs](./iqfts/README.md): Inverse Quantum Fourier Transforms 
* [Oracles](./oracles/README.md): Oracles for use with algorithms like Grover
