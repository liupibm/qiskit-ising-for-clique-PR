**We appreciate all kinds of help, so thank you!**

Contributing to the project
---------------------------

You can contribute in many ways to this project.

Issue reporting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a good point to start, when you find a problem please add
it to the `issue tracker <https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-acqua/issues>`_.
The ideal report should include the steps to reproduce it.

Doubts solving
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To help less advanced users is another wonderful way to start. You can
help us close some opened issues. This kind of tickets should be
labeled as ``question``.

Improvement proposal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have an idea for a new feature please open a ticket labeled as
``enhancement``. If you could also add a piece of code with the idea
or a partial implementation it would be awesome.

Code
----

This section include some tips that will help you to push source code.


Style guide
~~~~~~~~~~~

Please submit clean code and please make effort to follow existing conventions
in order to keep it as readable as possible. We use
`Pylint <https://www.pylint.org>`_ and `PEP
8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008>`_ style guide.

Good first contributions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You are welcome to contribute wherever in the code you want to, of course, but
we recommend taking a look at the "Good first contribution" label into the
issues and pick one. We would love to mentor you!

Doc
~~~

Review the parts of the documentation regarding the new changes and update it
if it's needed.

Pull requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We use `GitHub pull requests <https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests>`_
to accept the contributions.

A friendly reminder! We'd love to have a previous discussion about the best way to
implement the feature/bug you are contributing with. This is a good way to
improve code quality in our beloved SDK!, so remember to file a new Issue before
starting to code for a solution.

So after having discussed the best way to land your changes into the codebase,
you are ready to start coding (yay!). We have two options here:

1. You think your implementation doesn't introduce a lot of code, right?. Ok,
   no problem, you are all set to create the PR once you have finished coding.
   We are waiting for it!
2. Your implementation does introduce many things in the codebase. That sounds
   great! Thanks!. In this case you can start coding and create a PR with the
   word: **[WIP]** as a prefix of the description. This means "Work In
   Progress", and allow reviewers to make micro reviews from time to time
   without waiting to the big and final solution... otherwise, it would make
   reviewing and coming changes pretty difficult to accomplish. The reviewer
   will remove the **[WIP]** prefix from the description once the PR is ready
   to merge.

Please follow the next rules for the commit messages:

- It should include a reference to the issue ID in the first line of the commit,
  **and** a brief description of the issue, so everybody knows what this ID
  actually refers to without wasting to much time on following the link to the
  issue.

- It should provide enough information for a reviewer to understand the changes
  and their relation to the rest of the code.

A good example:

.. code::

    Issue #190: Short summary of the issue
    * One of the important changes
    * Another important change

A (really) bad example:

.. code::

    Fixes #190


Documentation
-------------

The documentation for the project is in the ``doc`` directory. The
documentation for the python SDK is auto-generated from python
docstrings using `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_ for generating the
documentation. Please follow `Google's Python Style
Guide <https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html?showone=Comments#Comments>`_
for docstrings. A good example of the style can also be found with
`sphinx's napolean converter
documentation <http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html>`_.

To generate the documentation, we need to invoke CMake first in order to generate
all specific files for our current platform.

See the previous *Building* section for details on how to run CMake.
Once CMake is invoked, all configuration files are in place, so we can build the
documentation running this command:

All platforms:

.. code:: sh

    $> cd out
    doc$> make doc
